# Homework for Sector Labs Junior Full-Stack Engineer 

This project was asigned to me during my recrutation period at Sector Labs. 

The main request was to recevie a username and output the repositories.

## Elevated Version 

I decied to elevate the homework and go a step further. 

## A Little GitHub profile view

Instead of just rendering some boring repository names (or gists), I decided to output a full profile of the username that is desired (photo, name etc.)

I used stuff learned from previous tutorials to be able to put this together.

### The above figure is an example of how a profile looks like.
